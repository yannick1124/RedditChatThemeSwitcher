I made this simple extension because I learned about an issue some Reddit users have with Chats, where the theme doesn't update properly. While I do not know how to fix this across browsers, since this is likely a fringe issue on Reddit's side, I do know that if you change the classes of `<html>`, you can switch the themes very easily. This is exactly what I made.
